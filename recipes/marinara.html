    <h2>This marinara sauce recipe is very easy to make and the only red sauce 
    my 5-year-old daughter will eat! Serve with your favorite pasta.</h2>
    
      <p>Homemade marinara is almost as fast and tastes immeasurably better than 
        even the best supermarket sauce — and it's made with basic pantry ingredients. 
        All the tricks to a bright red, lively-tasting sauce, made just as it is in the south of Italy 
        (no butter, no onions) are in this recipe. Use a skillet instead of the usual saucepan: 
        the water evaporates quickly, so the tomatoes are just cooked through as the sauce becomes thick.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>    
    
    <ul>
      <li>2 (14.5 ounce) cans stewed tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>⅓ cup finely diced onion</li>
      <li>½ cup white wine</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Place tomatoes, tomato paste, parsley, garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper in a food processor; 
        blend until smooth.</li>
      <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and cook until slightly softened, 
        about 2 minutes.</li>
      <li>Stir in blended tomato sauce and white wine.</li>
      <li>Simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
